The name Chiyozuru refers to this legend — Chiyo from Chiyoda and zuru, a derivative of the Japanese word for crane.<\/p><p>Not only did Kato achieve an exquisite cutting edge on the tools he crafted by hand, but he elevated these tools — instruments that disappear as they are put to use — to works of art. One of the great <em>kanna shokunin<\/em> (Master Craftsmen of planes), Kato created masterpieces in the Meiji, Taisho and Showa periods and came to be known by the signature Chiyozuru Korehide.<\/p><p>Kanki Yoshiryo, a kanna (plane) bladesmith in Hyogo Prefecture, apprenticed with Chiyozuru Korehide, mastering the bladesmith techniques and earning his own Chiyozuru signature — Chiyozuru Sadahide. Sadahide passed the name onto his son, Chiyozuru Sadahide III, who works tirelessly to pass the spirit and techniques of master bladesmiths on to the next generation.<\/p>"
